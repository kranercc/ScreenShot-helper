# This is for linux users

Install everything in "install_this_first.txt"
User `sudo` every time you open it, and make sure you use `python3` (linux has py2 and py3 installed)

By default the action button is on "`-`" because linux dosn't have a keycode or something i can use by default, so you need to map it yourself.
